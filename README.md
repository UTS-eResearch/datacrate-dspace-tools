# datacrate-dspace-tools
Python tools for extracting data from DSpace repositories into DataCrate format. 

This repository is for tools similar to the [DataCrate Omeka tools](https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/omeka-datacrate-tools) for the DSpace repository. Development will start with a DSpace collection to DataCrate script.
